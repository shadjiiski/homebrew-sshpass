# homebrew-sshpass
[sshpass](https://sourceforge.net/projects/sshpass/) formula for Homebrew.

Homebrew maintainers [reject adding](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/pull/18332) sshpass for security reasons, but some users need this.

## Install

```
brew install shadjiiski/sshpass/sshpass
```

Or `brew tap shadjiiski/sshpass` and then `brew install sshpass`.
